Kitty Run

https://github.com/AGLovett/FinalProject.git

Kitty run will be a side scroller mini game about a kitten running 
through a few diffrent scenes to hopefully get home!

I hope to make 3 diffrent envioments for my character to run through ( including the backgrounds and fitting obsticles)and maybe 2-3 cat sprits for running animation.

This project is going to have me creating alot of drawings with code and I will need to learn how to make them as cute as I want them to be and switch through the diffrent backgrounds and sprits fluidly.

The Ideal outcome is to have the cat go through 3 fluid scenes. I hope that  I am able to make it as complex as I want, because it'll help the charm and aesthetic of the game.

The Minimal viable out come would be to have 1 main enviornment with changing obsticles and after a certain number of obseticles jumped for the cat to make it home. This is much more possible than my original idea, but will not look as visual interseting. 

Milestones:

Week 12: Write diffrent enviorments and plan out code

Week 13: Write code for mechanics and simple sprits to test movement

Week 14: Write code for enviornments

Week 15: Write code for sprits

Week 16: Go through and ensure everything looks and behaves acordingly, general refining.
