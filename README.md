My game is called Kitty Run and it's a ever looping sidescroller game, much like the one google displays when your device doesn't have service! I took a lot of visual inspo from my favorite game Stardew Valley, it's made by one solo creator and it was originally supposed to me a basic game for his portfolio.

I started out by making a basic sidescroller with blocky shapes and colors and then slowly removed them as I updated the game with better visuals. The first update I made was a basic cat sprite, but that didn't feel complex enough so I animated a basic walk cycle for it. I struggled a lot with this at first because not only have I never done pixel art, but I hadn't attempted something of this scale before with code. I'm really proud of the pause during the jump I was able to add, because it would have looked a little off if the walking animation kept cycling.

After that I started on the background, and I think this took me the longest. Not only because I wanted to get the design just right, but it took a lot of trial and error to get the background to finally score with the rest of the game. This was the hardest part for me because even the smallest error would complete mess the background up, such as making it not scroll at all or making it glitch out. It took me almost a week to figure out the problem was just instead of repeating if self ***.x1 + BG_WIDTH <= 0:  self.x1 = self.x2 + BG_WIDTH twice that I needed to reverse it so it'd start back at frame one! I then had to play with the speed of the background, because it was messing with my eyes and I couldn't focus on the game.

The obstacles were luckily the easiest part due to all my trial and errors with the first two! I decided that instead of making just one obstacle to avoid I'd make three to add more variety to my game. I went with normal things you'd find in a neighborhood to expand on the idea that the player is trying to get the cat home! I went with a mailbox, a trashcan, and a gnome to give the game a more fun a cutesy feel rather than making the obstacles actual dangers to the cat. The obstacles cycle randomly so it's less boring and repetitive.

The one thing I'm upset I couldn't add was an ending screen. Every time I tried to get it to work no matter how basic I made it; it would make the whole game unplayable. I think with maybe in another week I could have figured it out, but with the rest of my finals also looming over it just wasn't going to happen.

Once again I'm really proud of all the work I was able to do on due to not being the most confident in my coding skills (or lack thereof), but I think I might keep adding to it in my free time as a small side project to keep my skills from degrading! I think other than just a end screen I'd like to add more levels if possible or make it scroll through different scenes. This was what I originally planned to do but I didn't have the time nor skill for this feat. I'm very proud of what I was able to do with this project in the end despite it being smaller than originally thought!

The different files are the different pngs I created for my sprites, and the gif I created of the walk cycle animation of the cat.
